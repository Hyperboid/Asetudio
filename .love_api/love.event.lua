--- Clears the event queue.
function love.event.clear() end

--- Returns an iterator for messages in the event queue.
---@return function
function love.event.poll() end

--- Pump events into the event queue.
--- 
--- This is a low-level function, and is usually not called by the user, but by love.run.
--- 
--- Note that this does need to be called for any OS to think you're still running,
--- 
--- and if you want to handle OS-generated events at all (think callbacks).
function love.event.pump() end

--- Adds an event to the event queue.
--- 
--- From 0.10.0 onwards, you may pass an arbitrary amount of arguments with this function, though the default callbacks don't ever use more than six.
---@param n Event # The name of the event.
---@param a Variant? # First event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param b Variant? # Second event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param c Variant? # Third event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param d Variant? # Fourth event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param e Variant? # Fifth event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param f Variant? # Sixth event argument. (Defaults to nil.)
---@param ... Variant? # Further event arguments may follow. (Defaults to nil.)
function love.event.push(n, a, b, c, d, e, f, ...) end

--- Adds the quit event to the queue.
--- 
--- The quit event is a signal for the event handler to close LÃ–VE. It's possible to abort the exit process with the love.quit callback.
---@param exitstatus number? # The program exit status to use when closing the application. (Defaults to 0.)
---@overload fun('restart':string):void
function love.event.quit(exitstatus) end

--- Like love.event.poll(), but blocks until there is an event in the queue.
---@return Event, Variant, Variant, Variant, Variant, Variant, Variant, Variant
function love.event.wait() end
